Space Station Defense

Tower Types

💥 Direct Damage – "Plasma Cannons"

    Look: Sleek, rotating turrets with glowing energy cores.
    Attack Method: Fires high-velocity plasma bolts or concentrated laser beams.
    Upgrades: Higher energy output (damage), faster cooling systems (fire rate), extended barrel for precision shots (range).
    Specialization Ideas:
        Railgun Variant – Slower but fires devastating hypervelocity projectiles.
        Arc Cannon – Sends electric bolts chaining between enemies.
        Dual-Blaster Mode – Twin-barreled death, higher DPS but burns more energy.

🌩 AOE (Area of Effect) – "Tesla Disruptors"

    Look: A cluster of floating orbs generating arcs of energy.
    Attack Method: Fires electromagnetic bursts or lightning waves that damage multiple enemies.
    Upgrades: Wider shock radius, stronger EMP bursts (more damage), faster charge-up.
    Specialization Ideas:
        EMP Overload – Slows or disables robotic enemies.
        Shockwave Generator – Releases pulses that knock enemies back.
        Nano-Cloud Emitter – Deploys a swarm of nanobots that erode enemy armor.

🛑 Debuff/Impedance – "Graviton Manipulators"

    Look: Floating gravity wells or anchored energy pylons.
    Attack Method: Distorts gravity to slow or pull enemies off course.
    Upgrades: Stronger gravity fields, larger effect radius, longer duration.
    Specialization Ideas:
        Singularity Trap – Creates a temporary black hole, sucking enemies inward.
        Repulsor Field – Pushes back enemies instead of slowing them.
        Chrono Field – Temporarily stops time for enemies caught in its radius.

Enemy Types

🦑 Swarmers (Small) – "Skitter Drones"

    Armor: None – They take full damage from all sources.
    Resistances: Very susceptible to slows and crowd control.
    Special Ability: "Swarm Instinct" – Moves slightly faster when near other Swarmers.
    Key Weakness: Slows & AOE – They die fast, especially if caught in Tesla or Graviton fields.
    ➡ Tactics: Slow ‘em down and watch ‘em drop.

🦍 Brutes (Medium) – "Shock Troopers"

    Armor: Light – Reduces a bit of damage but still vulnerable.
    Resistances: Moderate resistance to slows & debuffs.
    Special Ability: "Adaptive Shielding" – Gains temporary armor when below 50% HP.
    Key Weakness: Consistent damage output – Don’t let them sustain for too long.
    ➡ Tactics: Versatile enemy that requires a mix of AOE and single-target attacks.

🛡 Juggernauts (Large) – "Dreadnought Behemoths"

    Armor: Heavy – Takes reduced damage from most sources.
    Resistances: Immune to slows, gravity wells, and stuns.
    Special Ability: "Overcharged Reactor" – Explodes on death, dealing AOE damage to towers.
    Key Weakness: Very slow movement – Needs heavy sustained fire to take down.
    ➡ Tactics: Overwhelms defenses through sheer endurance—must be prioritized.
